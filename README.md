# Coreyja's Just Adios

An app to end Zoom Meetings after a Predetermined amount of time

## Scratchpad

This will integrate with the Zoom API to end meetings.

Auth will be done with OAuth at the User level.

We will check for any meetings the User has, and end them if they are active and have been running for longer than X minutes.
